Time Series – Prediction Task

Heart rate prediction : Sudden variations in heart rate could lead to the risks of stroke, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, 
and also death. Therefore, monitoring the heart rate is critical as it helps to discover the irregularities 
of the heart’s function to detect health problems. With the advancements in AI and stream processing 
technologies, more accurate future predictions also can be made, allowing healthcare sectors to 
detect and treat such situations at early stages.

In this task, you are given a time series collected using medical sensors, approximately four hours of 
data for a patient. Using these data, you need to build an effective time series model to predict the 
next twenty (20) observations (minutes) of heart rate data (Lifetouch Heart Rate). You can use any
time series model you want, either from the sessions or your own research based on the topics we 
discussed.
