Image Processing â€“ Prediction Task
1. Cat or Dog? 
In this challenge, you need to predict whether an image contains either a cat or a dog. 
This is useful for tasks such as animal species image recognition for restricting access. Even though a 
human being can easily differentiate between a cat and a dog, it is a tedious task that needs full-time 
availability. We can use machine learning to find an automated solution for that. 
You can use any machine learning algorithm to build the models, either from the sessions or your own 
research based on the topics we discussed.
Note: Use 100 as the value for any random state you set to generate comparative results.
